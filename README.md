The package "**parcel**" is installed locally as a dev-dependency. For that reason, in the **script** section of the **package.json** file, a new line is added as follows:
- "start": "parcel src/index.html"

We recommend to remove this line, if you have already installed this package _globally_. However, we recommend to use this package as a local dev-dependency to avoid any conflict between packages.
